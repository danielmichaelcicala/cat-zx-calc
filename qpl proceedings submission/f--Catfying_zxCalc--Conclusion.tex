\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

The main advantage of 
fitting the zx-calculus 
into a bicategory is that 
the rewrite rules are now 
explicitly included
into the mathematical structure.
That is, we are now capturing
a larger portion
of the full picture that is
the zx-calculus. 

However, categorifying the
zx-calculus is only
part of the story.
The methods used here
are general
with only slight tweaks
made to accommodate the
case at hand.  
Indeed, similarly to how
we use $\cat{zxRewrite}$
to capture zx-diagrams,
we can construct modified versions
of $\cat{Rewrite}$ to frame 
open Markov chains, resistor networks,
internal Frobenius algebras, etc
into this framework.
