\section{From open graphs to open objects} % section title

In the previous section,
we defined an open graph,
a important object of study
in network theory.
But for many networks,
open graphs are too structure poor.
They just don't capture all of
the information that a network may have.
And so, we need to generalize open graphs
to open objects.

Given categories $\cat{C}$ and $\cat{D}$
with coproducts together with a full and faithful
functor $L \from \cat{C} \to \cat{D}$
preserving coproducts, we define an
\defn{$L$-open object of $\cat{D}$} to be a cospan
of the form $ L ( x ) \to y \gets L ( z ) $.
When there is little chance for confusion,
we will merely use the term `open object'.

A morphism of open objects is a triple
$ (f,g,h) $ that fits into a commuting diagram

Much has been written about
graph rewriting theory. 
Here, we intend to extend
these results to open graphs,
and further, to open objects.
Lack and Sobocinski

have shown that topoi
admit a nice rewriting theory.
Hence, we prove the following
theorems.
