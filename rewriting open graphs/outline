  1) Abstract & Introduction

  2) define open graphs and their use
    and talk about who has considered them already.

  2) DPO rewriting of an open graph:
    Define the following
    (a) production (left linear and linear)
    (b) gluing conditions
    (c) derivation
    (d) grammar
    (e) languages

  2) prove the local Church-Rosser theorem.
      *In the paper "Adhesivity is not enough"
      by Sobocinski, et al, they prove the
      local Church-Rosser for left linear productions.
      Can we get a bicategory where
      the span of cospan legs are left linear,
      not just linear.*
        (a) define parallel and sequential independence
        (b) Church-Rosser like Theorem 5.5 in Sob.

  3) prove concurrency theorems
    (a) define dependency relation
      and dependency derivations
    (b) define concurrent prodution
    (c) concurrency theorem (5.9 in Adhesive Cats)

  4) fit this into the category REWRITE.
    Define a sub-bicategory of REWRITE
    generated by a language illustrated
    with the Frobenius monoid example
    from Kenny/my paper with Baez's idea that's
    the subcategory of the Karoubi envelope
    to get at 2Cob

NOTES:
1) DPO was introduced in ehrig, pfender and shneider. Graph-grammers:an algebraic approach
